{"body":"# Boiling City Via Instagram\r\n\r\nThis is prof of concept in how to consume realtime data from Instagram.\r\n## Demo\r\nThanks to [heroku.com](heroku.com) I managed to deploy it at [http://boiling-city-instagram.herokuapp.com](http://boiling-city-instagram.herokuapp.com)\r\n## How it works?\r\nThe application is reading the configuration variables from /server/config.js\r\nBased on _cityCoverage, tagSubscription _ it creates subscriptions for media. \r\nWhen a new photo is uploaded the instagram posts to the application the media information and the app will push the media to browsers that are connected via sockets.\r\n\r\n## How to configure?\r\n* Open file /server/config.js\r\n* Add your domain to the variable _domainName_\r\n* Add your Instagram _clientId_ and _clientSecret_ to the _instagramConfig_ object. (reference: [Instagram Developer API](http://instagram.com/developer/)\r\n\r\n## How to run it?\r\n`node app.js`\r\n\r\n## For developers:\r\n* It creates subscription automatically when the first socket.io receives a new connection.\r\n* It unsubscribes automatically when there is no one connected via socket.io\r\n* It creates a cache from the first images that were search based on the _tagSubsciption_ array and it will update that array every-time a new media was pushed to the browser.","google":"UA-36787781-2","name":"Boiling-city-instagram","tagline":"Instagram api, dublin city, realtime, node.js, sockets.io","note":"Don't delete this file!
